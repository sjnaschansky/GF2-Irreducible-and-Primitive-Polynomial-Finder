Old-Ver-for-DOS

This DOS version of the program searches for irreducible & primitive polynomials.
The program uses unreal mode (big real mode) of Intel x86 microprocessors.
Therefore, it most likely will not work under Windows.
This source code looks like a mess.
Therefore, I temporarily decided not to publish the code.
